Element	Function / Purpose
;@:	Initialization command, often tells the plotter a new job is starting.
SET MARKER_X_DIS	Sets the X-axis distance between OPOS markers (in plotter units).
SET MARKER_Y_DIS	Sets the Y-axis distance between OPOS markers.
SET MARKER_X_SIZE	Size of each marker along the X-axis (used for OPOS alignment).
SET MARKER_Y_SIZE	Size of each marker along the Y-axis.
SET MARKER_X_N	Number of markers along X-axis (e.g., 2 markers = front & back).
LOAD_MARKERS.	Command to tell the cutter to read/load OPOS marks for registration.
END.	Ends the initialization/config block.
;:HOA,ECN,U,	Configuration or internal mode command. Often repeated. Meaning varies by machine.
,U	Pen Up ‚Äì move to a coordinate without cutting.
,D	Pen Down ‚Äì start cutting from this point onward.
X,Y values	Coordinate values in plotter units (1 unit = 0.025 mm if 120 units = 3 mm).
P6	Tool/Pen change command. Summa interprets this as switching cut type:
‚Üí Usually from kiss-cut (light) to die-cut (deep)
e@	End of the plot file. Resets or finishes job.
üõ†Ô∏è Cut Path Convention
Before P6: Usually interpreted as kiss cut.

After P6: Treated as die cut.

Summa uses layers or tool commands like P1, P2, ..., P6 to control cut pressure/tools.

üìê Units and Scaling
Based on 120 units = 3 mm, Summa plotters often use 1 unit = 0.025 mm.

All coordinates are in this unit system and must be scaled accordingly when converting from Illustrator.
